  localtime: long -> struct tm

Time() has a pointer arg. If not NULL, the current time will also be
written there.  Time_t is an alias of long int.

  time: -> time_t

strftime() extracts fields from struct tm, coverts to a string
representation, and writes that string value to the provided
buffer. The reruned value is the number of bytes written including a
final 0. A return of 0 *may* indicate an error.

  strftime(buf, bufsize, templ, value ...) -> size_t
